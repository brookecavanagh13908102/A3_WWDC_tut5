# A3_WWDC_tut5
## Introduction
For my A3 WWDC artefact, I designed a data visualisation using Tableau to analyse the audio features from a list of 2000 songs on Spotify. The aim of this project was to create an interactive display of popular songs from the 20 year time period, and their qualities to allow users to investigate what they like about a paritcular song. The project is still in development, with the intent to link all tracks with their respective Spotify URI's and embed them into the data visualisation.
### Technologies
Project is created with:
The Kaggle Data set created by Mark Koverha Top Hits Spotify from 2000-2019: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/paradisejoy/top-hits-spotify-from-20002019.
